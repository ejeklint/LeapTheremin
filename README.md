# Leap Theremin

This is just a lab to figure out how well (or bad) the Leap can work as a two-handed theremin. Currenty using a somewhat dated macaudio module. I guess there are other macaudio npm modules which are maintained but this was what I first found.

Translation from position to frequency is linear now. This needs to be changed to give a more natural feeling for posision vs. tone.
